# COMP9001-Final-Project-AnimeTracker
AnimeTracker is a lightweight Python program that allows users to record, view, and analyze their anime-watching activities. Users can add, delete, search, and rate animes. The program can also display basic statistics (e.g., total count, average rating, most-watched genres) and provide simple recommendations based on usersâ€™ preferred genres.

The 'Year' field is flexible. You can use it to store either the anime's original release year or the year you watched it, based on your preference.

# Update 1
